I always believed that adding a multivendor network certification to your skill set enhances your knowledge, increases your career flexibility, and makes you a valuable asset in the dynamic field of networking.

With the above in mind, last year I decided to resume my JNCIE-SP studies exam by using the [Juniper's Open Learning Program](https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=JUNIPER-OPEN-LEARNING#static) as my training resource.

# The Juniper Open Learning Program
Juniper has made it easy to prepare for certifications through this program by offering free certification courses and discounted exam vouchers. This applies to exams from the Associate level up to the Expert level. The program operates in three steps:

1. *Start your training for free*: Access free certification-specific courses to kickstart your training.
2. *Earn your discounted exam voucher*: Juniper includes a Voucher Assessment Test in each certification course. Completing all course modules and passing the Assessment Test qualifies you for a discount on your live exam.
3. *Pass your live exam and you're Juniper Certified!*

# Why Passing Three JNCIA Exams
The Juniper Open Learning Program has specific requirements for certain exams. For example, in order for you to subscribe to one of the Expert-level courses/Vouchers, *you must hold an active JNCIP certification in the corresponding track and have three active Associate-level, and two active Specialist-level certifications*.

The above is the reason why I had to pass the following three Associate-level exams in the last two months:
- JNCIA-Design.
- JNCIA-Junos.
- JNCIA-DevOps.

Note that I only used the courses from Juniper Open Learning Program as study resources to pass these exams.

# What's Next?
I'll have to pass two Specialist-level exams in order to progress with the program and currently I'm studying for the JNCIS-Ent.

Thanks for reading!
